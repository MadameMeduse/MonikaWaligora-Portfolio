          <h1>Java Script workshops by WarsawJS</h1>
          <p>
            WarsawJS is a local community of JavaScript professionals and
            enthusiasts. They meet every month to talk and debate about their
            favorite programming language. This community is focused on sharing
            experience from different fields on which JS is used, from web
            browsers, to servers, dev tools, mobiles, smart tvs, micro
            controllers, databases, video games and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had the pleasure to attend Java Script workshops to broaden my
            programming knowledge in this language. There were many enthusiastic
            tutors such as @Bartosz Legięć, who managed my team, ready to help
            us with every problem we find in our project. We spend the whole day
            coding, sharing experiences and solving problems. It was a huge
            inspiration for me!

          <h1>Hello Roman means hi Adam!</h1>
          <p>
            Roman or @Adam Romański is one of my favourite characters among
            programmers. And it's not because I had the opportunity to meet him
            personally and he turned out to be a very nice guy (it sounded like
            he was not, but he is), but because his YouTube channel @Hello Roman
            is a masterpiece.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have never watched video tutorials before, because they are
            usually made by amateurs and are simply deadly boring. Adam / Roman
            does not say anything that is absolutely necessary to understand a
            given topic. Translates simply, bluntly and always with an example.
            At the beginning of my path of disguise, he gave me faith that I
            would succeed. He had previously worked as a copywriter in
            advertising agencies and was developing musically as a drummer, so
            we have almost the same background. And he succeeded. So why
            wouldn’t I?
          </p>
          <p>
            In mid-May, I had the opportunity to participate in Hello Roman &
            Friends, the first Meet-up organised by Adam at the @Netguru
            headquarters in Poznań. It was an extraordinary experience that
            enriched me with another portion of knowledge about the IT world,
            and made me realize how a friendly relationship of an employee with
            a company can be, that does not just support the passion of its
            people, but actually helps them to realize it.
          </p>
          <p>
            All those who are beginning their adventure with programming, as
            well as those already a bit more advanced, I encourage you to check
            out the Hello Roman youtube channel, and listen to one of his jokes
            at the beginning of each episode ;)

          <h1>Meet-up by Women in Technology</h1>
          <p>
            Another productive meeting behind me! Preparations to work in the IT
            industry is a really exciting and developing journey. This time I've
            participated in meet-up "How to effectively change the industry for
            IT" organised by the @Women in Technology. Meet-up was aimed at
            broadening of the contacts network, delving into recruiters
            expectations, and personally - it raised my sense of readiness for
            the IT market. A great initiative of women - for women. Thanks a lot
            girls!
