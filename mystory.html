        <h1>People say that I'm talented. They are wrong though.</h1>
        <p>
          I believe talent is something you are born with... And I'm simply
          <b>curious</b> in many different areas. Ever since I was young, my
          parents encouraged me to answer questions that I myself asked and I
          often heard the phrase "well what do <b>you</b> think?".
        </p>
        <p>
          They instilled in me the curiosity that germinated my entire
          childhood. I was curious how it is to transfer the three-dimensional
          world onto a flat sheet, which is why I enrolled in a
          <b>drawing course</b>
          at a near Art School.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was curious to find out how it is to play on stage with several
          people, in one rhythm, connected with the joy of sound, so
          <b>I learned to play the drums</b>, which stole my heart and I play to
          this day.

          I took part in <b>workshops for leaders</b>, because I wanted to learn
          how to communicate with others so that they listen, feel comfortable
          and want to cooperate. I was curious about how it is to live and study
          abroad, so <b>I spend a year in Greece doing my master's studies</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was employed at a <b>marketing agency</b> because it fascinated me
          to be able to direct my communication to a specific group of
          individuals in such a way that they would be willing to do things they
          would never have thought about before.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was at this agency, during onboarding, that I first saw code. I was
          shown how to work with Google Analytics code, which allows tracking
          user traffic on the entire site by measuring time, clicks and other
          actions. This code had one line ...
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember how improbable it seemed to me what I saw then and what it
          woke up in me ... <b>curiosity I have never experienced before.</b> I
          went to demo lessons at a programming school, where we worked on the
          completed code. I could not believe that through a few lines of text
          you can create such amazing things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started to study alone at home, <b>I created my first website</b> by
          replacing images and texts. When I saw the effect, I knew that in the
          end I found something that will never satisfy my curiosity - because
          programming science never ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Changing technologies, modern tools, the ability to improve my
            skills on every project.</b
          >
          These are triggers that drive me and my brain to act.
          <b>This curiosity has led me to coding</b>, and a real passion for
          learning about the world. It's not a talent, I am working very hard to
          make my dream come true.
